The **2020 NMLO Competition Six** dataset is specifically designed for object detection tasks, featuring 1176 images with annotations centered around a singular class â€” *car*. As an integral segment of the NMLO contest, part 6, this dataset is geared towards training object detectors utilizing the YOLO model architecture to detect custom objects within a series of images. 

The dataset primarily consists of images depicting cars on roads, captured from a side-view-mounted camera on a vehicle. The training data includes annotations exclusively focusing on the car class or background (nothing), with bounding boxes specified to precisely train models to identify and locate cars within the images, providing a targeted resource for object detection model development.
